mla_Buffers_pass
================

This is a mental ray geometry shader for writing out the mila layer buffers. 
For that you need mental ray version 3.11.x that is in the Autodesk product line 2014.

The shader have also a GPU AO option, so you can write out a ambient occlusion pass in the same time by a normal rendering.
