/// mental ray C++ shader interface extensions.
///
/// This is a new C++ interface for shaders which extends the existing C-style
/// shader interface to mental ray. It is implemented as abstract interface
/// classes which do not require symbol lookups across dynamically loadable
/// library boundaries, like shaders. It also makes it possible to provide new,
/// even incompatible versions of the interface later.
///
/// Binaries which have been compiled with an older version of this header file
/// typically work with newer versions of this interface as long as the new
/// member functions have been appended at the end of the existing classes.
///
/// mi_shader_if.h is included from shader.h if the shader is compiled as C++
/// code; a shader does not need to include mi_shader_if.h directly.
/// 
/// The namespace alias shader_v3 is used to avoid conflict of inlined 
/// symbols between shader libraries compiled with different version.
/// On Linux platforms, this relaxes the requirement to link shader libraries
/// with the -Bsymbolic option.
